Hello there! Welcome to the Tutorial!
I know, I know, you probably know all this stuff...

Oh.
You actually stayed.
Well then.
Let's get started.
Use WASD to move.
~
Nothing suprising so far right?
Press I to open your inventory.
~
You can use Esc to exit or you know...
Use the button at the top right...
No, do not close the website please, I meant the inventory screen...
~
Next up let me tell you about consumeable items.
You're able to heal outside of battle by pressing Q and selecting the character you want to heal.
Yes, I know there is only 1 right now, but still.
Come on try it!
~
You get it!
Now, there only seems to be one way you could go, let's see what's up ahead!
~
Wow it's a chest, let's check it out!
Press E to interact with objects.
~
You recieved a potion!
It gave you a potion, very nice.
Look out for objects to interact with, as it may contain something valueable or necessary for you to continue!
ß
It seems like someone else wanted that potion as well.
Let's defend ourselves.
Đ010
 ...
What?
That's all you need to know.
Now go, get out of here!
Ł
It was a sunny afternoon...
Working in the forest like I always did...
(It's getting late...I should head home for today)
~
Something seems strange here...
(Someone...or something is here)
Đ010
What was that? Was that...a monster? Really?
(Doesn't matter, I have to hurry now!)
.
~
-Skye, I'm so glad you are okay!
Chief! What's going on here? These monsters are everywhere!
-I'm not sure myself, but we have to fight! Let's talk after we defeated all of them!
@
ß0
I think that's all of them.
-For now at least.
Where did all of them come from?
-I don't know... We will find that out tomorrow, you should rest up for now!
Very well then.
,
-Good morning! Now that you're awake, shall we go?
Sure.
ä
~
-Skye, let me teach you something, I think you will be able to do it!
#
{You have learned the 'Slash' skill}
I did it! Thank you, I will make good use of this technique!
~
-Hold on Skye, this seems interesting! A trail of corpses, all leading deep into the forest.
I say we go and investigate it.
-We should...but I have a bad feeling about this...
ß1
Monsters...a lot of them...this is bad.
-We can't defeat them now. We should turn back.
ß2

-Let's head back to the village for now!
ä
~
-What we discovered is...scary to be frank.
We are not ready for that yet.
-No, definitely not. Right now what we need is more weapons and armor...
For who?
-For anyone who is willing to fight... Skye, gather resources then report to me. Meanwhile I will look for new fighters.
Okay.
(Maybe I should look around the area and fight some monsters while I'm at it.)
@
~
ß3
(That should be enough, let's head back.)
ä
~
-You're here at last, I take it that means you have gathered enough...
This should be enough for a few weapons.
-I've got you, give me a second...
(...)
ł
{You've recieved a 'Stone sword'}
-Here, a new sword for you! There should be enough for a few of us as well. Speaking of which, I managed to recruit a couple of newbies.
The more the merrier, they are very welcome.
-I'm glad they could join, but remember they are still in training, they are not ready, nobody is.
You're right. We should find a way to get stronger!
-I will think about it, meanwhile a request came up from one of the citizens, take a look..
@
Alright, consider it done.
-Thank you, oh and if you have some materials and resources let me know. I can always make you something new.
Sure thing Chief, see you later.
-See ya.

-Skye, I thought of a way we could get stronger. We are hosting a tournament among each other, so we can learn each others skills.
Seems like a good idea. Looking forward to it.
-Great, talk to me when you are ready.
ä
~
-Are you ready then?
Yeah, let's go!
Ł
-Welcome fighters to this makeshift tournament! Remember our goal today is to learn from each other. Our real enemies are waiting for us outside.
(...)
-Anyways, I wish you all good luck, let's begin Round 1.
Đ010
-Easily taken care of, but don't get ahead of yourself, she is just a rookie.
-Onto the next one!
Đ010
-Skye with the victory, great showing of skills out there for both of you. Let's patch you up, before we continue.
-And with that we have 2 contestants left, let the final round commence.
Đ010
(*Crowd cheers*)
-Gentleman, we have a winner! Congratulations, you showed us amazing skill and will to fight.
(*Crowd cheers*)
-You deserve a reward as well. You know that I have served our cavalry in the past.
Of course Chief, we talk about it all the time.
-Than you could also remember that I have kapt my chestplate as a souvenir...but now it's yours!
Are you sure?
-Yes, that is my gift to you as well as a reward for your efforts today. Hope you all learned a lot today!
ł{You have recieved a 'Knight's chestplate'}
Which skill would you like to take?
*
-...And with that I would like to thank you all for participating today. See you tomorrow!
(I need a rest at home)

-Skye, report came up that nearby posts are being overwhelmed, please go and help them out!
On it, Chief!
ä

_Skye, glad you have arrived! Monsters have ambushed the place overnight. There is too many of them.
(It's strange, they are tough, but the guard should have been able to hold them up.)
What's the situation out there, why are we struggling so much?
_I don't know, we are dealing heavy blows on them, but it doesn't seem to affect them.
(...Seems like I just have to get out there and see for myself)
Don't worry about it, keep hold of them for now, I will join you. 
Đ110
(They do seem a bit tougher... but I still don't get it...)
_Over here! I think we found it!
(Found what?)
Đ120
So this shaman was healing up the others, that's why they seemed unbeatable?
_I guess that explains it, doesn't it? Oh and also...not just healed...but resurrected as well.
Well...that's new...but I guess not unexpected. Great work today, I'm going back to the village and send your relief as soon as possible.
(What more do they have?...)

Listen up please! Monsters have been taken care of. Any guards available please report to duty to take over from the injured.
_Got it! Hurry up guys!
(These guys are amazing. No need for motivation, ready for anything. We have good people here, that's why I need to protect them...)
ä

-Skye, heard you took care of thing out there, great job!
Thank you.
-Here this is for you.
ł{You've recieved a 'Potion' and 'Common Leggings'}
-A small reward for your efforts today.
It was the least I could do. Glad the village is safe for the time being.
So...what's next?
-What should be next?
I don't know it's just... you always have something for me to do, you know. Figured it's the same this time.
-Well there is one thing actually... rumour has it that there is a book lost in the forest to the east. Could you take a look?
If you say it's worth it...sure why not.
(At least I get to look outside for a bit, see what it's like)

{You've acquired the 'Book of Martial Arts'}
This is it, finally found it. Took me longer than expected. Let's go back now... Ohh man.
ä
~
Hey Chief, I found the book you wanted, here you go!
-Thank you, Skye.
Can I ask why you needed it?
-Of course, it's for the rookies. Their training is almost ready with this.
The last battle took a lot from us, but their spirits are still not broken. They are tough.
-Thankfully yes, but they still lack combat experience... so I thought you could take one of them out for field practice.
I don't see a problem with it.
-Great, then please talk to me to choose a companion, when you are ready.
ä
~
-Please choose who you would like to train!
*
Let's get going then!
@
~
(These were a lot for a trainee, but he handled it very well. Might have found a gem Chief...)
Let's slay some more, than I think that it for toda... What is that?..*
Đ030
(That monster was tough, we don't have much time if they are getting tougher and increasing their numbers as well...)
You know what... I think I have seen enough...or rather we have seen enough, I think you got enough experience for today.

-Welcome back, how did he do?
Very well actually, but we had to cut it short... a new kind of monster has appeared, we defeated it, but it is tougher than any before.
-The both of you? Well then it was a worthy experience indeed.
It was, although I have my concerns.
-About what?
About how we can defeat all of them, I believe we have waited long enough. Think about it, it is pointless to wait anymore, they will only get stronger.
They evolve, just as humans do. Now we can defeat them, but that might not be the case later.
-I...agree. We won't have a better chance than this any time soon, but if are going to do this, everyone needs to be alerted and ready.
Are you sure everyone will be okay with this?
-No, how could I be... but we have the best chance now, their numbers will only get significantly larger.
Plus we can move with a smaller more powerful squad with backup.
-Exactly. We spearhead an attack from the center, push through and take out their chief. The others will deal with the mess then we can help them later.
It's a risky plan, but it could work... I'm with you of course. You can count on me.
-I know Skye, I'm going to talk about it with the squad, you should rest then talk to me, when you're ready to go!
ä
~
-Skye, I have good news, everyone agreed with our plan, after they are prepared, they shall meet us at the entrance to the nest.
I'm glad everyone is in support. They are real fighters. Last I remember though the entrance was blockaded with stones and other heavy object.
-You remember correctly, I already sent a squad to clear that up. It didn't hold 'em up enough, so we might as well extend our line of defence there.
So I guess that's our meeting spot.
-Yes it is, take care of anything you feel like beforehand, than the three of us will go first in.
My trainee is coming huh? He is very talented, I just really hope I'm not too overconfident... I'm a bit afraid of the results after all.
-We have what we have, no point in doubting yourself now.
You're right. I'm sorry.
-Don't be, all of us are afraid a bit. We just hide it well.
All the more reason why I need to be stronger.
-That's what I'm talking about. See you there, Skye.
Yes Chief!

-So...we are ending it today, aren't we?
That's the plan, I'm ready to go whenever you are.
-Let's go then.

-The path to danger begins here, no turning back now.
Like I would...Let's begin.
@
~
-Looks like there will be even more of them from now, be careful.
~
(This place looks and feels like danger...like death... got to move on)
~
-Look! Their nest, we are very close. Gear up and rest if you need to.
~
-Look, Skye whatever happens here, just know that I'm grateful to you for everthing that you've done! For the village, for me, you're a hero!
Thank you, truly! This is not goodbye though, we will win here! We are stronger!
(At least I hope...)
~
The final boss guys! Let's do this!
~
We have done it! The warrior leader has fallen.
-Oh my, this was exhausting, but at last we can rest easy...
